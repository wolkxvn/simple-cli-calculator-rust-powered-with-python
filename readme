# Rust-Powered Simple Calculator (CLI Version)

This is a simple command-line calculator application with computational backend functions written in Rust. The Rust functions are compiled into a shared library and called from Python using the `maturin` tool.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Command-line interface built with Python.
- High-performance computations using Rust.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Rust (with `cargo` package manager)
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- `maturin` (for building Rust extensions)

## Example Usage

python calculator.py add 5 3
python calculator.py subtract 10 4
python calculator.py multiply 7 8
python calculator.py divide 20 4
